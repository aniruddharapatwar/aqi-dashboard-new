TEST SET METRICS (2025 Jan-Aug - PURE REGRESSION LSTM)
================================================================================

TRAINING APPROACH:
  ✓ Year-based split (Train: 2021-2024, Test: 2025)
  ✓ Model learns ALL seasonal patterns (4 full years)
  ✓ Includes May-Aug from 2021-2024 (prevents distribution shift)
  ✓ NO validation set (early stopping on training loss)
  ✓ Pure MSE loss (no custom loss)
  ✓ No class balancing
  ✓ No oversampling
  ✓ Longer sequences (48-240 timesteps)
  ✓ Rolling mean/std features
  ✓ Multi-lag features (24h, 48h, 72h, 168h)
  ✓ Strong regularization (dropout 0.3, L2, batch norm)

REGRESSION METRICS
  MAE:  35.67 µg/m³
  RMSE: 49.85 µg/m³
  R²:   0.8267
